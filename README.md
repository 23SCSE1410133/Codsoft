## 👋 Overview

Welcome to my project repository for the **Data Science Virtual Internship** at [CodSoft](https://codsoft.in/). During this internship, I completed **three hands-on machine learning tasks** that helped me explore the end-to-end ML workflow — from data cleaning and visualization to model building and evaluation.

Each task is structured inside its own folder, containing the dataset, Jupyter notebook, and README for clarity.

## 🧠 Completed Tasks

### 📌 Task 1 – Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
Built a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on age, class, gender, and other features.

- **Model:** Logistic Regression
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
- **Accuracy:** ~80%

### 🌸 Task 2 – Iris Flower Classification
Developed a simple yet powerful classifier to identify the species of Iris flowers using sepal and petal measurements.

- **Model:** K-Nearest Neighbors (K=3)
- **Dataset:** Kaggle CSV version
- **Accuracy:** ~97%
- **Visualization:** Pairplot + Confusion Matrix
